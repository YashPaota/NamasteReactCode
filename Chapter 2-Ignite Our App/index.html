<!-- 1. Its not recommended to use CDN but its goot for learning knowledge. SO we will install React npm 
    install React.We are not doing npm install -D React because we want it o production also.We want it in global.As soon it gets installed you will se dependencies also in package.json.Now install react-dom same as raect.

   2.Now with the help of parcel execute command npx parcel entry_point_of_application that is npx parcel index.html. By This , parcel will give us a server. Now we need to import react and Reactdom from nodemodules.Other wise we will get error.

   3. If we run this without type attribute in script tag we will get some error because our js file has some import and Browser does not understand import.It does not acts as a normal javascript file.SO we need to tellbrowser it is not a normal js file rather it is an module to browser. Thats why we use type="module".
